SQL Queries for my tripdata project

TripData is a comprehensive data analysis project that aims to explore, analyze, and visualize trip-related data. This project helps in understanding patterns, trends, and insights from trip data to enhance decision-making for transportation and travel services.

1. Data Collection
   
   Creating Database and Tables:
- CREATE DATABASE tripdata_2013;
- CREATE TABLE tripdata (...): Initial table creation to store the raw trip data.
  
   Loading Data:
- LOAD DATA INFILE '...Divvy_Trips_2013.csv' INTO TABLE tripdata: Loading the CSV data into the tripdata table.

3. Data Cleaning and Preparation
   
   Copying Data for Backup:
- CREATE TABLE trip_data AS SELECT * FROM tripdata;: Creating a backup of the original data for further modification.
  
   Modifying Data Types:
- ALTER TABLE trip_data MODIFY COLUMN starttime DATETIME, MODIFY COLUMN stoptime DATETIME;: Converting date columns to proper DATETIME format.
  
   Removing Unnecessary Characters:
- UPDATE rides_data SET birthyear = TRIM(TRAILING '\r' FROM birthyear);: Removing trailing characters.
  
   Handling Missing Values:
- UPDATE rides_data SET birthyear = NULL WHERE LENGTH(birthyear) = 0;: Converting blank birth years to NULL.
- UPDATE rides_data SET gender = NULL WHERE gender = '';: Converting blank genders to NULL.
  
   Changing Data Types for Optimization:
- ALTER TABLE rides_data MODIFY birthyear YEAR;: Modifying birthyear to the YEAR data type.
- ALTER TABLE rides_data MODIFY COLUMN gender ENUM('Male', 'Female') NULL;: Converting gender to ENUM for memory efficiency.

3. Data Validation

   Checking for Duplicate and Null Values:
- SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(trip_id))...: Checking for duplicate trip_id values.
- SELECT * FROM rides_data WHERE trip_id IS NULL...: Checking for NULL or invalid values in key columns.
  
   Validating Data Formats:
- SELECT DISTINCT(gender) FROM rides_data;: Checking distinct values for the gender column.

4. Data Transformation
   
   Creating Tables for Subscribers and Customers:
- CREATE TABLE tripdata_subscriber AS SELECT * FROM rides_data WHERE usertype = 'Subscriber';: Separating data for subscribers.
- CREATE TABLE tripdata_customer AS SELECT * FROM rides_data WHERE usertype = 'Customer';: Separating data for customers.
  
   Adding Derived Columns:
- CREATE TABLE rides_data_ AS SELECT *, DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(starttime, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s'), '%W') AS dayofweek FROM rides_data;: Adding a dayofweek column based on starttime.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Calculating Descriptive Statistics:
    Average and Maximum Ride Duration:
- SELECT AVG(tripduration)...: Calculating average ride duration for overall data, customers, and subscribers.
- SELECT MAX(tripduration)...: Calculating maximum ride duration for overall data, customers, and subscribers.
  
   Mode (Most Frequent Value) of Trip Duration:
- WITH Mode_Calc AS (...) SELECT...: Calculating the mode of trip duration for both customers and subscribers.
  
   Ride Counts by Day of the Week:
- SELECT dayofweek, COUNT(DISTINCT(trip_id))...: Counting the number of rides by day of the week for overall data, customers, and subscribers.
  
   Identifying Peak Hours:
- SELECT HOUR(starttime)...: Identifying the busiest hours for customers and subscribers.
  
   Monthly Ridership Trends:
- SELECT MONTH(starttime)...: Analyzing monthly ridership patterns for trend analysis.

6. Reporting and Presentation
   
   Identifying Peak and Low Periods:
- Reports peak ridership hours and busiest months for both customers and subscribers.
This categorization follows the Data Analytics Lifecycle, which includes data collection, cleaning, validation, exploration, and reporting.
